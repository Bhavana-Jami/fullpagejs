            If you’re just now becoming familiar with what a gradient is, we’ll paint the picture for you before we dive into the tougher stuff. A gradient is a progression of colors with a starting and stopping point – so, a linear gradient starts with one color (like a red) and gradually transitions in a straight line to another color (like a blue). Like we said in our linear-gradient article, think about sunsets as the best example of a linear gradient and how each color progresses beautifully and seamlessly into the next.

Text Gradient

Direction
Your text gradient isn’t so different from your linear gradient, specifically when it comes to direction. You can define the linear gradient angle in the code with a keyword or number and unit. With a keyword, you would use variations of to bottom, to top, to left, and to right to determine where the line should move to from the starting point. These directional keywords can be combined-like to top right or to bottom left-to create a diagonal line. You could also use number and unit pairings to determine the angle and direction of the line.
